Overview
This repository contains a Python-based Warehouse Management System designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system helps manage inventory, track stock levels, process orders, and handle supplier relationships, providing a comprehensive and scalable solution for efficiently managing warehouse operations.

Features
1. Inventory Management
Add, Update, and Delete Items: Easily manage warehouse inventory by adding, updating, or removing items.
Track Stock Levels: Monitor stock levels for each item to prevent stockouts and overstocking.
Search Functionality: Quickly find items in the inventory by item ID, name, or category.
2. Order Management
Create and Process Orders: Generate new orders and process them by automatically updating inventory levels.
Order Tracking: Maintain a history of all processed orders for audit and tracking purposes.
Order Status Updates: Track the status of orders (e.g., pending, processed, shipped) to manage workflow efficiently.
3. Supplier Management
Supplier Database: Maintain detailed records of suppliers, including contact information and product lists.
Order from Suppliers: Generate orders to suppliers directly from the system to replenish stock.
Supplier Performance Tracking: Monitor supplier performance metrics such as delivery times and order accuracy.
4. User Interface
Console-Based Interface: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for interacting with the system.
Data Validation: Ensures that user inputs are correctly formatted and valid before processing.
5. Reporting
Inventory Reports: Generate reports detailing current stock levels, inventory valuation, and reorder points.
Order Reports: Create reports on order history, including fulfilled, pending, and canceled orders.
Supplier Reports: Analyze supplier performance and order history for informed decision-making.
